Verizon 5G challenge - Hackathon 2023

This project connects cars to the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) Architecture using a 5G network. The simulated 5G network is a simplified representation of a network that connects to cars using a IP address (unique id). The cars can broadcast individual sensory data to the MEC, and the MEC can thus create a visual representation of the roadway. The MEC can then sort the relevant data and ping individual cars with relevant information about the roadway ahead.
